Nvidia launches Nemotron stack for production-grade AI agents.](https://hackernoon.com/the-nvidia-nemotron-stack-for-production-agents?source=rss)\r\n\r\n- NVIDIA released Nemotron, a production-grade AI agent stack integrating speech, retrieval, and safety models designed to work cohesively.\r\n- Nemotron offers 10x faster ASR, multimodal document retrieval, and advanced safety models with open weights and consistent hardware targets.\r\n- This stack addresses latency, accuracy, and compliance challenges, shifting focus from LLMs to integration layers in AI agent deployment.\r\n\r\n[? Anthropic releases expanded 84-page Claude AI constitution.](https://www.computerworld.com/article/4120916/anthropics-claude-ai-gets-a-new-constitution-embedding-safety-and-ethics-2.html)\r\n\r\n- Anthropic has released an expanded 84-page constitution for its Claude AI, embedding ethical and safety principles into its reasoning. The document guides Claude to prioritize safety, ethics, user benefit, and compliance with Anthropic?s guidelines during model training. Released under a Creative Commons CC0 deed, it is available for other developers to adopt.\r\n- This new constitution shifts from rule-based constraints to a philosophical framework enabling Claude to generalize ethical reasoning beyond checklists. The 23,000-word document aims to deepen Claude?s understanding of concepts like privacy and morality, enhancing operational safety and ethical compliance across use cases. Anthropic commits to transparency on missteps and ongoing evaluation for specialized models.\r\n- The update responds to growing concerns about AI ethics and safety, including debates on AI consciousness and moral status. While Anthropic explores these issues in the constitution, experts stress that human accountability remains crucial. The release signals broader industry engagement on embedding ethical frameworks amid regulatory and societal scrutiny.\r\n\r\n[? Five graph neural network breakthroughs to watch in 2026.](https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-breakthroughs-in-graph-neural-networks-to-watch-in-2026)\r\n\r\n- Graph neural networks (GNNs) see five key breakthroughs in 2026, involving dynamic graphs, scalable fusion, LLM integration, scientific applications, and security.\r\n- These advances enhance real-time analytics, multi-hop reasoning, and domain discovery, enabling efficient, explainable AI in enterprise and research sectors.\r\n- Security frameworks and certified defenses address adversarial risks, critical for regulated deployments in finance, energy, and infrastructure systems worldwide.\r\n\r\n[? Open Notebook offers open-source private NotebookLM alternative.](https://www.kdnuggets.com/open-notebook-a-true-open-source-private-notebooklm-alternative)\r\n\r\n- Open Notebook launches as an open-source, AI-powered private note-taking platform offering full user data control and local deployment.\r\n- It supports AI-assisted summarization, multimodal content, podcast generation, and flexible AI model integration, enabling customizable workflows.\r\n- Positioned against Google NotebookLM, it emphasizes privacy, self-hosting, and open development, mitigating vendor lock-in and data exposure risks.\r\n\r\n[??
