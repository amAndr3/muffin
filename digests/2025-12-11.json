Its Findings Might Explain Why Shopify and Adobe Just Went All-In on AI. \r\n\r\n[Microsoft](https://microsoft.ai/news/its-about-time-the-copilot-usage-report-2025/) just analyzed 37M+[ Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) conversations, and surprisingly, the answer to ?what do people actually use AI for?? isn't what you'd expect.\r\n\r\n**For starters:** Health questions topped every category. Every device, every hour, every day of the week. People reached for AI more for wellness tracking than coding (which actually makes since most folks use other AI like Claude Opus 4.5 or GPT-Codex for coding).\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the time of day you ask a question matters too: At 2 a.m., people asked about philosophy. During work hours, they planned travel (lol). Weekdays meant programming, and weekends meant gaming.\r\n\r\n**Here?s Microsoft's other key findings:**\r\n\r\n* Top 5 uses of Copilot: searching, advice, creating, learning ,& technical support.\r\n\r\n* Desktop users explored 20 different topic combinations; mobile users stuck to 11.\r\n\r\n* January conversations focused on programming; by September, they'd shifted to more about society and culture.\r\n\r\nOh, and if you?re worried about the privacy of your copilot chats, read this: the study only extracted summaries, never actual conversations. Privacy secured!?\r\n\r\nRead the [full report here](https://microsoft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/What_people_do_with_Copilot-8.pdf).?\r\n\r\nIn the world of AI for commerce, there was also major news today: [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2026) shipped 150+ updates showing businesses embedding AI into commerce operations rather than treating it as a bolt-on feature.\r\n\r\n**What Shopify launched:**\r\n\r\n* [Sidekick](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2026#sidekick-generates-apps), Shopify's AI assistant, now generates custom apps, builds automations, edits themes from plain English.\r\n\r\n* [Catalog API](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2026#shopify-catalog-api) gives developers access to millions of products with one integration (live now for developers who want to add commerce infrastructure).\r\n\r\n* [SimGym](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2026#shopify-simgym-app) uses AI shoppers trained on real sessions to test changes before launch (this one?s wild).\r\n\r\n* [Agentic Storefronts](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2026#shopify-agentic-storefronts) syndicate products across all major AI platforms automatically.\r\n\r\nThe [Sidekick](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2026#sidekick-pulse) shift is interesting. It basically evolved from reactive helper to strategic advisor. Here?s how it works:??\r\n\r\n* Type a request, get a custom admin app.?\r\n\r\n* Describe a workflow, Sidekick builds the automation.\r\n\r\n* Need theme changes? Just tell it what you want.\r\n\r\n**The bigger unlock though:**[ Agentic Storefronts](https://www.shopify.com/news/winter-26-edition-agentic-storefronts). Shopify merchants now set up once and their products appear in[ ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/),[ Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), and[ Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) conversations. One integration puts them everywhere AI shopping happens.\r\n\r\n**Why this matters: **AI has stopped being a category of apps and is starting to become infrastructure for daily life. Microsoft's data proves people already treat it as ambient support for health, creativity, and personal decisions. Shopify proves businesses are building it into fundamental operations: commerce, customer service, product discovery.\r\n\r\nAnd [Adobe proved this today, too](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/adobe-brings-photoshop-express-and-acrobat-features-to-chatgpt/). As promised at MAX, the company _literally _embedded Photoshop, Express, and Acrobat directly into ChatGPT. Users can now tell the chatbot to edit images, remove backgrounds, merge PDFs, or animate designs without leaving the conversation. \r\n\r\nMajor platforms like ChatGPT and Copilot are becoming places where shopping happens. Businesses that treat AI as optional bolt-on features will watch competitors embed it into every operation, from inventory to checkout.?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2406a12e-9fba-4e0e-a97a-ac78b7d48009/image.png?t=1762454334)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**FROM OUR PARTNERS**\r\n\r\n# [How to stop bots from abusing free trials](https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=neuron&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q42025)\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9b5a0d1f-8cc1-4d6d-a3b2-eb9dc0dcecaa/image.png?t=1765424415)\r\nFollow image link: (https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=neuron&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q42025)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nFree trials help AI apps grow, but[ bots and fake accounts exploit them](https://workos.com/blog/what-is-free-trial-abuse?utm_source=neuron&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q42025).

Engineer [BOOTOSHI ](https://x.com/KingBootoshi/status/1998930471313617114)says most of us are killing our coding agent efficiency by continuing conversations?and the fix is simple: reset completely between features.\r\n\r\n**His workflow:** plan ? build ? test ? document ? **reset context from scratch**. No continuing threads, no accumulated fluff.\r\n\r\nWhy it works: Each new feature gets fresh context instead of dragging along irrelevant details from previous builds. Think of it like opening a new Google Doc instead of scrolling to page 47 of your messy running notes \r\n\r\nGeoffrey Huntley (an Opus user) [echoes this](https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1998928565921018163): when AI gets it wrong, it's usually because we under-specified in a cluttered context. His fix? `git reset --hard` or just start a completely new prompt.\r\n\r\n**Don?t worry non-engineers, this applies to you: **Got a new task?
