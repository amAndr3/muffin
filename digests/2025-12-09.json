Turns out most organizations _aren't even close. _\r\n\r\nOpenAI [just dropped](https://openai.com/index/the-state-of-enterprise-ai-2025-report/) its first-ever [?State of Enterprise AI? report](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf), analyzing usage data from 1M business customers and surveying 9K workers. The findings are wild, and if you're not among the ?frontier? users, you're leaving serious productivity on the table.\r\n\r\n**The headline numbers are staggering: **\r\n\r\n* ChatGPT now serves 800M weekly users, with Enterprise adoption exploding 9x year-over-year. \r\n\r\n* Weekly messages grew 8x since last November? \r\n\r\n* ?And companies are consuming 320x more reasoning tokens than they were 12 months ago (_makes sense, thinking is about only about 16 months old). _\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3aa1746b-ede8-4f29-9d34-551a75923783/Screenshot_2025-12-08_at_1.28.56_PM.png?t=1765231400)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**Now here's where it gets interesting.** The average Enterprise worker saves 40-60 minutes daily using AI. Heavy users? They're saving more than 10 hours per week. _Basically an extra workday per week!_\r\n\r\n**Real-world examples:**\r\n\r\n* Lowe's answers 1M customer questions monthly with Mylow, and when shoppers engage with it, conversion rates more than double.\r\n\r\n* Indeed reports job seekers using their AI Career Scout are 38% more likely to get hired and find jobs 7x faster.\r\n\r\n* Moderna compressed analytical work from weeks to hours in drug development planning.\r\n\r\n* BBVA built 4K+ Custom GPTs and automated 9K legal queries annually, redeploying three full-time employees to higher-value work.\r\n\r\n* Intercom's Fin Voice resolves 53% of support calls without human intervention?and when calls do escalate, they're resolved 40% faster.\r\n\r\n**The productivity secret? Frontier workers do AI **_**different**_**.** \r\n\r\n* They send 6x more messages than the median employee. \r\n\r\n* Among data analysts specifically, top performers use the data analysis tool 16x more than their peers. \r\n\r\n* Workers who save 10+ hours weekly consume 8x more AI intelligence than those saving zero hours.\r\n\r\nEven wilder: 75% of workers report completing tasks they previously couldn't perform at all, like coding, data analysis, or creating custom workflows. \r\n\r\nCoding-related messages from non-technical workers jumped 36% as people discover they can now build things without traditional programming skills. \r\n\r\nB_tw, if you need a project idea to build on your _[_newfound Codex skills_](https://www.theneuron.ai/explainer-articles/from-zero-to-codex-hero-everything-you-need-to-know-about-openais-coding-agent)_, try building a Chrome extension! They?re super easy and can get up and running in 3 easy steps. Just say ?let?s turn this into idea a chrome extension [idea here]. Walk me through it step by step.? ). _\r\n\r\n**But there's a massive gap emerging.** \r\n\r\n* Frontier companies send 2x more messages per employee than median firms, and 7x more through structured workflows like Custom GPTs. \r\n\r\n* Among monthly active Enterprise users, 19% have never tried data analysis features, 14% never used reasoning models, and 12% never tried search capabilities. \r\n\r\n* For those powerful capabilities to just sit unused? _That's leaving money on the table._\r\n\r\n**Why this matters:** OpenAI says organizations mastering AI deployment are pulling ahead, w/ 1_.7x revenue growth_ and _3.6x greater shareholder returns_ ([according to BCG](https://www.bcg.com/press/30september2025-ai-leaders-outpace-laggards-revenue-growth-cost-savings)). The gap between frontier firms and median performers will likely widen as AI capabilities improve faster than most companies can adapt.\r\n\r\nIf your team isn't among the frontier users yet, the good news is the playbook is clear: \r\n\r\n1. Get executive buy-in\r\n\r\n2. Enable [data connectors](https://chatgpt.com/features/connectors/). \r\n\r\n3. Build repeatable workflows\r\n\r\n4. Train people to use AI across multiple task types (_forget trad domains; everyone should learn to code and use agents. It?s almost 2026, y?all)_. \r\n\r\nThe companies doing this now are building advantages that will be hard to catch as the [pace of change gets faster and faster](https://www.julian.ac/blog/2025/09/27/failing-to-understand-the-exponential-again/).\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/582dc14f-f15e-4aea-813e-9129ca2acd5b/image.png?t=1764643249)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**FROM OUR PARTNERS**\r\n\r\n# Stop Clicking.
