Now imagine ones so hard they've stumped mathematicians for decades. Paul Erd?s, who published more papers than anyone in math history, left behind hundreds of these puzzles when he died in 1996. This weekend, [GPT-5.2 Pro solved one](https://x.com/neelsomani/status/2010215162146607128).\r\n\r\nNeel Somani prompted the AI to tackle [Erd?s Problem #397](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/397), which asks whether infinitely many solutions exist for a specific equation involving central binomial coefficients. GPT-5.2 generated the proof, the tool [Aristotle](https://aristotle.harmonic.fun/) formalized it in Lean (a verification language), and Fields Medalist Terence Tao accepted it.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1de4dd7e-c778-4785-99a0-d28d0b88d6c5/Screenshot_2026-01-11_at_3.13.00_PM.png?t=1768173357)\r\nFollow image link: (https://x.com/neelsomani/status/2010215162146607128)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Here's what makes this a milestone:**\r\n\r\n* **It?s part of a wave of autonomous solves**: GPT-5.2 has now cracked [Problem #728](https://www.erdosproblems.com/728), [#729](https://x.com/Liam06972452/status/2010054665539662224), and 397.\r\n\r\n* **Verified mathematics**: The Aristotle system auto-corrected gaps in proofs and produced Lean-verified code.\r\n\r\n* **Self-contained reasoning**: Unlike October 2025's GPT-5 controversy (which just found existing literature), Tao says [these are original proofs](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1q7u78b/terence_taos_writeup_of_gpt52_solving_erdos/).\r\n\r\n**The catch?** Tao emphasizes these are ?lowest hanging fruit?; problems solvable with standard techniques, not profound breakthroughs. GPT-5.2 scores 77% on competition-level math but only 25% on open-ended research requiring genuine insight.\r\n\r\n**Why this matters:** For knowledge workers, we're watching AI transition from pattern-matching to proof-generation. When models can autonomously solve decade-old problems (even straightforward ones), expect this to accelerate across fields requiring logical reasoning: contract analysis, regulatory compliance, engineering optimization.\r\n\r\nOver the next 6-12 months, watch for GPT-5.3 (or whatever is next) and competing models from Google/Anthropic to systematically tackle the remaining ~660 unsolved Erd?s problems. If you work with structured problem-solving, start experimenting with how these models handle your domain's equivalent \"Erd?s problems\"; those nagging challenges everyone knows about but nobody's solved.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7cf99573-4593-460e-bb90-7154a8d863f4/image.png?t=1765839774)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n# Prompt Tip of the Day \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0115273e-79e6-4f97-8825-04fdb44feba0/Screenshot_2026-01-11_at_12.25.46_PM.png?t=1768163167)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpvQH0r0ecM)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nGreg Isenberg and Ryan Carson ([of Amp](https://ampcode.com/)) [break down](https://youtu.be/RpvQH0r0ecM?si=rMoKkRzzt5dCYYos) the viral [?Ralph Wiggum? Agent workflow](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) and how to implement it in your own projects ([here?s Ryan?s full explanation](https://x.com/ryancarson/status/2008548371712135632)).  \r\n\r\nThe key trick is turning all your PRDs (product request docs) into a JSON format with strict evaluation criteria to consider it ?done?, then running the Ralph.sh command. The agent then works through each request, testing it along the way, and updates the PRD once its done, and then loops through the rest of your open requests. \r\n\r\nEssentially, this lets your coding agents work overnight while you sleep, and because each request is very tightly scoped, it only costs say $3 in tokens, so a list of 10 features could cost you $30 to implement. Definitely watch the video, because Ryan and Greg talk about what you need to do to make all this work as effectively as possible.\r\n\r\nCheck out [Ryan?s Amp Skills](https://github.com/snarktank/amp-skills) here, and his [Ralph implementation](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph?tab=readme-ov-file) here. \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9e6a7aea-cc49-46bf-9bdc-9f20a844784e/image.png?t=1767995569)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n# Treats to Try \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/eecd838e-758e-47dd-a9d1-f8b37a0af8d4/image.png?t=1767890069)\r\nFollow image link: (https://wisprflow.ai/?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n1. *[Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter) turns your speech into clean, final-draft writing across email, Slack, and docs.
