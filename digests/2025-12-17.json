The model is rolling out now to all ChatGPT users and is [available in the API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images) as GPT-Image-1.5 ([docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation)). \r\n\r\n**Here's what makes it different: **The new model preserves what matters. When you ask for edits, it changes only what you specify while keeping lighting, composition, and people's appearance consistent across multiple edits. \r\n\r\nTranslation: _no more accidentally transforming your subject's entire face into a hideous Renaissance painting alternate universe version of itself when you just wanted to change the background. _\r\n\r\n**Where GPT Image 1.5 excels:**\r\n\r\n* **Precise editing**: Add, subtract, combine, blend, or transpose elements without losing the image's essence.\r\n\r\n* **Text rendering**: Finally handles dense, small text accurately (think readable newspaper layouts, not jumbled letters).\r\n\r\n* **Instruction following**: Creates intricate compositions with proper relationships between elements?like an actual 6x6 grid with 36 different objects, each in the right spot.\r\n\r\n* **Creative transformations**: Apply preset styles instantly; turn photos into movie posters, 80s fitness ads, or fashion campaigns while preserving key details.\r\n\r\n* **Speed**: Up to 4x faster than the previous version, so you can iterate without the wait.\r\n\r\nOpenAI also launched a [dedicated Images interface](https://chatgpt.com/images/) in the ChatGPT sidebar with preset filters, trending prompts, and one-time likeness uploads (kinda like [Sora Cameos](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12435986-generating-content-with-characters)) for easier creation.\r\n\r\n**How does it stack up against the competition? **According to[ independent benchmarks](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2001016199094948185), OpenAI dominates:\r\n\r\n* **Text-to-image:** GPT Image 1.5 leads with 1264 points on the[ Artificial Analysis leaderboard](https://artificialanalysis.ai/image/leaderboard/text-to-image)?a 29-point lead over second place.\r\n\r\n* **Image editing:** ChatGPT's image model tops[ LM Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/image-edit) at 1409 points, narrowly beating Google's Nano Banana Pro (2K) by 3 points, and has a 6 point lead over Nano Banana Pro on Artificial Analysis? [image editing leaderboard](https://artificialanalysis.ai/image/leaderboard/editing). \r\n\r\n* **Improvements: **+147 points in [text-to-image](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text-to-image) and +245 points in editing over GPT Image 1.0 on [LM Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/image-edit).\r\n\r\n**Think of it like this: **GPT Image 1.5 = speed and precision edits. Nano Banana Pro = production-grade assets with additional enterprise features.\r\n\r\n**Why this matters**: AI image generation just crossed a critical threshold. For the first time, these tools can actually preserve what you care about while changing what you want? reliably. No more generating 50 versions hoping one works. \r\n\r\nIf you create visual content for work, try the new ChatGPT Images interface to test it out or [test both models head-to-head in LM Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) or [AA Image Arena](https://artificialanalysis.ai/image/arena) to see which fits your workflow better.\r\n\r\n**P.S: **We tested it on the same challenge we gave Nano Banana Pro in our [live-demo of GPT-5.2](https://www.youtube.com/live/5r3CiTJ3_z4?si=ZJ-p0x_RsBPYEZCC&t=6457) on Friday, and [this is what it created](https://chatgpt.com/share/6941da07-d8cc-8003-8723-aad812e4bbb8). \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2406a12e-9fba-4e0e-a97a-ac78b7d48009/image.png?t=1762454334)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**FROM OUR PARTNERS**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/729e2d12-db89-48ad-919b-da82fb722c99/AI_SOC_Webinar_-_640x320px.png?t=1765833506)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.tines.com/webinars/product-spotlight-building-an-ai-driven-soc-at-scale-with-reddit/?utm_source=TechnologyAdvice&utm_medium=paid_media&utm_content=newsletter-primary-1612)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to see how one of the internet?s largest platforms,?**Reddit**, is using AI to boost SOC efficiency?

You'll see Reddit's real implementation, learn how to combine AI agents with rule-based workflows, and watch a live demo of building your own AI SOC from scratch.\r\n\r\nWhether you're just starting to explore AI in security or already deep in the weeds, you'll walk away with practical steps you can implement immediately.\r\n\r\n[**Watch the on-demand webinar here**](https://www.tines.com/webinars/product-spotlight-building-an-ai-driven-soc-at-scale-with-reddit/?utm_source=TechnologyAdvice&utm_medium=paid_media&utm_content=newsletter-primary-1612)**.**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6bc85194-60ad-4700-a890-08be35e73a02/image.png?t=1762454365)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n# Prompt Tip of the Day\r\n\r\nTired of juggling docs, Slack threads, and random context across 12 tools?

[OpenAI](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-router-relaunch-gpt-5-sam-altman/) quietly rolled back ChatGPT's model router (the system that automatically sent queries to reasoning models) for free and $5/month users; it was too expensive and hurt daily active users, so they're back to the default fast model with manual reasoning access.\r\n\r\n2.
