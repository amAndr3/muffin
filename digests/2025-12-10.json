IDK if you?ve done this lately, but they?ve gotten _scary _good. \r\n\r\nOur new favorite thing is to write stream of consciousness prompts about our friends and family, listing all the weird things we know about them, and then instead of having the AI write the lyrics, have the AI _use the prompt as the lyrics._ [Here?s one for Corey](https://suno.com/s/FRxDM4c1orbnx0Jc)!\r\n\r\nThey?re actually HILARIOUS (_and WAY better than they have any right to be)_.

Here?s why:  **\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/05d64856-7492-473a-a28e-64bed22020e5/Screenshot_2025-12-09_at_5.33.35_PM.png?t=1765330441)\r\nFollow image link: (https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n* [Menlo Ventures just releases a new 2025 report](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/) that shows companies spent **$37B** on genAI this year. \r\n\r\n* That?s up **3.2x** from **$11.5B in 202**4, making it the fastest-scaling software category in history.\r\n\r\n* Today, **76%** of AI use cases are purchased rather than built internally. \r\n\r\n* **The most revealing stat: **AI deals convert at **47%** vs. traditional SaaS's **25%** rate, because the productivity gains are immediate AND measurable. \r\n\r\n_Yeah, __[tell that to MIT](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/)__ (__[just playing](https://hbr.org/2025/08/beware-the-ai-experimentation-trap)__)! _\r\n\r\n**Okay so what does this actually mean?** Enterprises pivoted from building to buying. Ready-made solutions reach production faster, but only if they work together. That's what AAIF solves.\r\n\r\nConsider coding, which became AI's first killer use case at **$4B in 2025** spending (up from **$550M in 2024**). Anthropic now commands 54% market share in enterprise coding spend with 18 months [atop coding leaderboards](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard). That makes open standards like [AGENTS.md](https://AGENTS.md) critical for preventing vendor lock-in.\r\n\r\n**More wild data from Menlo?s report:**\r\n\r\n* **27%** of AI application spend comes through product-led growth (where individual employees discover tools, prove they work, then convince their companies to buy). \r\n\r\n  * That?s nearly **4x** traditional software's **7%** rate, btw! Also, Cursor apparently reached **$200M** in revenue before hiring a single enterprise sales rep.\r\n\r\n* The infrastructure layer (the behind-the-scenes tech that powers AI apps, like model APIs and data storage) captured **$18B.**\r\n\r\n* **Caveat:** only **16%** of enterprise deployments actually qualify as true agents (most are just simple if-then workflows, not systems that actually think and adapt).\r\n\r\n_We're early. _Which is exactly why AAIF matters. Anthropic's MCP co-creator David Soria Parra [told TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/openai-anthropic-and-block-join-new-linux-foundation-effort-to-standardize-the-ai-agent-era/): ?We're all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.?\r\n\r\n**The skeptical take:** Will AAIF become real infrastructure or just another industry logo alliance? That said, Linux Foundation director Jim Zemlin pointed to Kubernetes ?winning? the container race as proof that ?dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.?\r\n\r\nIf MCP, AGENTS.md, and Goose become standard infrastructure, the agent landscape shifts from closed platforms to an open, mix-and-match software world. _We just need the same thing to happen for memory (so you can take your memories with you when you change providers) and preferences (how you like your tasks done, now handled by prompts and project folders, and does overlap a lot with memory, but not perfectly). _\r\n\r\n**What's next:** Menlo predicts AI will exceed human performance in daily practical programming tasks**_ in 2026_**.

Corey talks to Stefano Ermon, CEO of [Inception Labs, about Mercury](https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/blog/introducing-mercury), a new kind of AI model that generates text completely differently than ChatGPT or Claude.\r\n\r\n**Here's the deal:** \r\n\r\n* Most AI models you use today are ?autoregressive,? meaning they write one word at a time, left to right, and can never take anything back. \r\n\r\n* Diffusion models flip that approach. They start with pure noise (like random gibberish), then gradually refine it into coherent text through multiple passes? kinda like sculpting a block of marble into a statue.\r\n\r\n* Why does this matter? Because diffusion models can process many tokens simultaneously instead of one-at-a-time, making them 5-10x faster than traditional language models like GPT. Plus, they're trained to fix their own mistakes during generation, potentially leading to more accurate outputs.\r\n\r\nInception Labs just released Mercury ([try it here](https://chat.inceptionlabs.ai/)) as the first commercial-scale diffusion language model, and the results are impressive: comparable quality to speed-optimized models like Gemini Flash and Haiku, but at a fraction of the cost and latency.\r\n\r\n_Speaking of frontier and diffusion, _Google is cooking up its [own diffusion model](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/) too?\r\n\r\n**P.S before you dip: **We just noticed Claude web (and desktop, we presume) added the option to pay per message when you get cut off by its rate limits. \r\n\r\n_This is clutch! _Are we gonna pay? _IDK man? but this is a much needed option on tight deadlines (like today?) _\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7f562de1-e3d5-4eda-888f-1656f347ac39/image.png?t=1765330698)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/35ade56c-dc70-4dd0-b632-41c7c45a953a/image.png?t=1762454492)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n# A Cat?s Commentary\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7cf6a789-64ce-40c3-9e5b-38436bb77491/A_Cat_s_Commentary_x_2025__88_.png?t=1765328591)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/48e1e056-a015-4e20-ba68-dafb942cfae7/image.png?t=1762454543)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat?s all for today!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/77725261-a9a1-4f4b-9b32-5df2cf3f0b60/image.png?t=1762454662)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
