AppGuard report warns AI malware defenses are inadequate.](https://hackernoon.com/appguard-critiques-ai-hyped-defenses-expands-its-insider-release-for-its-next-generation-platform?source=rss)\r\n\r\n- AppGuard's new report reveals AI-powered malware outpaces current defenses, challenging detection-based cybersecurity approaches.\r\n- The company promotes a \"default-deny\" Zero Trust model, reducing endpoint attack surfaces with fewer rules and adaptive policies.\r\n- AppGuard reopens its Insider Release for experts to test its next-gen endpoint platform amid rising AI-driven cyber threats and alert fatigue.\r\n\r\n[? CORGI benchmark tests complex business text-to-SQL queries.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07309)\r\n\r\n- CORGI introduces a new text-to-SQL benchmark targeting complex business queries, developed by Yue Li et al., reflecting real enterprise data needs.\r\n- It features synthetic databases from companies like DoorDash and Airbnb, testing queries from descriptive to predictive and recommendational types.\r\n- LLMs show a 33.12% lower success rate on CORGI versus prior benchmarks, highlighting challenges in causal reasoning and forecasting in business contexts.\r\n\r\n[? MAGMA memory fixes AI agents' \"why\" reasoning flaws.](https://www.aiacceleratorinstitute.com/ai-agents-struggle-with-why-questions-a-memory-based-fix/)\r\n\r\n- Researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas and University of Florida developed MAGMA, a multi-graph memory architecture for AI agents.\r\n- MAGMA organizes memory into temporal, causal, entity, and semantic graphs, enabling improved reasoning over ?why? questions in AI systems.\r\n- It achieved 70% accuracy on long-term reasoning benchmarks, reducing latency and token use, but adds engineering complexity and depends on LLM quality.\r\n\r\n[? Google Antigravity IDE starts agent-first AI development era.](https://www.kdnuggets.com/google-antigravity-ai-first-development-with-this-new-ide)\r\n\r\n- Google launched Antigravity IDE on Nov 18, 2025, pioneering the \"agent-first\" AI coding era with Sergey Brin's direct involvement.\r\n- The IDE uses autonomous Gemini 3 agents to automate coding, testing, and debugging, shifting developer roles to architects of vision.\r\n- Built from a VS Code fork, Antigravity demands robust systems and redefines workflows, emphasizing goal-oriented prompts and plan reviews.\r\n\r\n[?? Chinese AI model trained fully on Huawei chips.](https://www.computerworld.com/article/4116792/chinese-ai-firm-trains-state-of-the-art-model-entirely-on-huawei-chips-2.html)\r\n\r\n- Chinese AI firm Zhipu AI trained its GLM-Image model entirely on Huawei Ascend Atlas 800T A2 chips, bypassing Western hardware.\r\n- This marks a first for a state-of-the-art multimodal AI model trained fully on domestic chips amid US export restrictions.\r\n- The model excels in text-accurate image generation, leading benchmarks, and is offered via API at low cost for enterprise use.\r\n\r\n[? US imposes 25% tariff on Nvidia H200 AI chips to China.](https://www.theverge.com/news/862938/us-taiwan-chipmaking-deal-250-billion-investment-tsmc)\r\n\r\n- The US Commerce Department announced tariffs on Taiwanese goods will drop from 20% to 15%. Taiwan tech firms will invest $250B in US chipmaking.\r\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. leads this with $100B already committed, planning six fabs in Arizona to expand US production.\r\n- The deal allows tariff-free imports during construction, but a 100% tariff remains possible if firms don't build in the US, reflecting geopolitical risks.\r\n\r\nOther spark insights!\r\n\r\n[?? MechStyle AI enables 3D printing durable personal items.](https://news.mit.edu/2026/genai-tool-helps-3d-print-personal-items-sustain-daily-use-0114)\r\n\r\n[?
