Energy Secretary Chris Wright says they'll \"recreate the center of the sun on Earth\" and turn deadly cancers into manageable conditions within years. Sounds incredible, right?\r\n\r\nHere's the kicker: this is exactly the problem.\r\n\r\n## The Productivity Chasm\r\n\r\nSince ChatGPT launched in late 2022, S&P 500 companies have seen productivity surge **5.5%**. Small businesses? They've **fallen 12.3%**. That's a 17.8 percentage point gap in under three years. The Big Four?Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta?are dropping **$364 billion** on AI infrastructure this year alone. Amazon's automation plans will eliminate 160,000 future jobs by 2027, saving them $2-4 billion annually.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, 95% of AI projects at small businesses fail before producing value. Most SME leaders can't even figure out what AI does for their specific business. We're watching a K-shaped economy crystallize in real-time: the top 10% now account for 50% of consumer spending while entry-level job postings have crashed 35% since early 2023.\r\n\r\n## The Government Response\r\n\r\nSo what's Uncle Sam doing about this? Building two supercomputers for elite research labs.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong?fusion energy and cancer cures are worthy goals. But here's what this partnership really represents: **more concentration at the top**. AMD gets validated as a player alongside Nvidia. Oak Ridge National Laboratory gets three times its current AI capacity. Big Tech gets another government-backed showcase for massive capital deployment.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses get... nothing.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, DOE's reasoning accidentally reveals the whole game. Wright said \"AI is moving fast. If we move at the old speed of government, we're going to get left behind.\" Translation: We're in an arms race, and only entities with nine-figure budgets can play.\r\n\r\n## What This Actually Means\r\n\r\nThe Lux supercomputer goes live in six months?**the fastest deployment AMD's CEO has ever seen**. Discovery arrives in 2028 as a next-gen exascale beast. Both will accelerate research in energy, medicine, and defense. Wright says there will be \"dozens\" more partnerships like this.\r\n\r\nBut who's building the AI infrastructure for the pizza shop trying to optimize inventory? The accounting firm drowning in compliance work? The regional manufacturer competing with automated giants?\r\n\r\nNobody. Because there's no $1 billion public-private partnership for them.\r\n\r\n## The Paradox\r\n\r\nMcKinsey calls it the \"gen AI paradox\"?80% of businesses use generative AI, yet 80% report no bottom-line impact. Meanwhile, Microsoft is saving $500 million in call centers alone. Walmart's CEO says AI will \"change literally every job\" for their 2.1 million workers. Amazon plans to automate 75% of operations.\r\n\r\nThe gap isn't just widening?it's becoming structural. We're not talking about a temporary advantage. We're watching the permanent stratification of the American economy, where computational power determines your competitive position and only the biggest players can afford admission.\r\n\r\nWright wants to win the \"AI race.\" Fair enough. But maybe ask: **who's actually racing, and who's just getting run over?**\r\n\r\n_The DOE-AMD partnership launches in 2026. The small business failures are already here._\r\n\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\nYou are reading a plain text version of this post.
