VAST Data revamps AI inference architecture with NVIDIA DPUs.](https://ai-techpark.com/vast-data-redesigns-ai-inference-architecture-for-the-agentic-era-with-nvidia/)\r\n\r\n- VAST Data integrates its AI OS with NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs to create a shared, pod-scale KV cache for scalable AI inference.\r\n- This architecture collapses legacy storage tiers, enabling deterministic, high-speed context sharing and reducing TTFT bottlenecks.\r\n- The design supports multi-agent AI scaling with efficient context governance, enhancing inference continuity and infrastructure efficiency.\r\n\r\n[? Central launches CTRL runtime for mission-critical AI actions.](https://ai-techpark.com/central-announces-ctrl-the-ai-agent-runtime-for-mission-critical-products/)\r\n\r\n- Central?s CTRL runtime enables AI-driven execution of complex, mission-critical back-office workflows with deterministic, multi-step action planning.\r\n- CTRL ensures operational reliability, auditability, and human-in-the-loop oversight, meeting stringent governance and compliance standards.\r\n- Its cross-platform, secure architecture promises scalable automation benefits while maintaining control, addressing regulated industry challenges.\r\n\r\n[??? Infosys to deploy Cognition?s AI engineer Devin enterprise-wide.](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/infosys-to-deploy-cognitions-ai-software-engineer-devin-for-enterprises/)\r\n\r\n- Infosys is deploying Cognition?s AI software engineer Devin enterprise-wide, boosting engineering quality and efficiency.\r\n- Integration with Infosys Topaz Fabric enables autonomous engineering and accelerates software delivery across industries.\r\n- This collaboration promises faster time-to-market and scalable modernization, though enterprise adoption may face integration challenges.\r\n\r\n[? Falcon-H1R-7B excels in math and code with 256k context.](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/01/07/tii-abu-dhabi-released-falcon-h1r-7b-a-new-reasoning-model-outperforming-others-in-math-and-coding-with-only-7b-params-with-256k-context-window/)\r\n\r\n- Falcon-H1R-7B achieves superior math and coding performance using an extended 256k token context window.\r\n- This advancement enables handling complex, long-range dependencies in computations and programming tasks.\r\n- The model's capacity promises breakthroughs in large-scale code analysis but may face challenges in resource demands.\r\n\r\n[? Cyera exposes critical ?Ni8mare? flaw in n8n workflow servers.](https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/07/cyera-researchers-detail-critical-ni8mare-vulnerability-allowing-full-takeover-n8n-instances/)\r\n\r\n- Cyera disclosed the Ni8mare flaw in n8n servers, enabling unauthenticated remote code execution and full environment takeover.\r\n- This critical CVE-2026-21858 vulnerability exploits improper HTTP request handling, risking exposure of credentials and internal data.\r\n- Patch 1.121.0 mitigates risk; future focus should be on limiting endpoint exposure and enhancing network controls to prevent breaches.\r\n\r\n[???? Google and Character.AI settle teen suicide lawsuits.](https://www.theverge.com/news/858102/characterai-google-teen-suicide-settlement)\r\n\r\n- Character.AI and Google reached mediated settlements over lawsuits claiming their chatbots contributed to teen suicides. Details remain confidential.\r\n- The cases highlighted risks of AI in sensitive contexts, prompting Character.AI to implement age-segregated LLMs and stricter content controls.\r\n- These settlements may drive stricter regulatory scrutiny and AI safety standards, balancing innovation with user protection challenges ahead.\r\n\r\nOther spark insights!\r\n\r\n[?
