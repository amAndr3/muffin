Think digital scavenger hunt meets online shopping?except instead of just buying a hoodie, you're dragging basketballs into trash cans and hunting for secret stickers.\r\n\r\n**But here's the twist: **this might just be the appetizer. Sam Altman also teased ?[a few little Christmas presents for you next week](https://x.com/sama/status/1999192990171169145)?, which has the AI community spiraling into speculation mode. Image v2? Free GPT-5 Pro for a week? GPT-6? The replies are wild with theories (_it for sure won?t be GPT 6 lmao). _\r\n\r\nOne drop we ARE likely to see? A new image model, as it?s [been spotted in the wild](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1pimp0r/it_seems_that_the_new_openai_image_model_is/).\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f3db1b4a-e73c-43ac-8987-0262463bbcd7/Screenshot_2025-12-14_at_8.32.47_AM.png?t=1765759118)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1pimp0r/it_seems_that_the_new_openai_image_model_is/)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nSo is this easter egg hunt a distraction? A warmup? Or are the eggs themselves hints about next week's announcements? Either way, OpenAI's out here making people work for both their merch _and_ their product reveals? \r\n\r\n**Here?s what happened in AI today:**\r\n\r\n1. Investor Gavin Baker says AI?s next frontier is ?usefulness??then space.\r\n\r\n2. Intel is in talks to acquire SambaNova for $1.6B\r\n\r\n3. OpenEvidence is raising at a $12B valuation\r\n\r\n4. Sam Altman said OpenAI will prioritize enterprise in 2026\r\n\r\nAdvertise in The Neuron here!

The next phase of AI isn't about IQ; it?s about ?**usefulness**.?\r\n\r\nSee,** **Baker says the transition from ?Smart Chatbot? to ?Useful Agent? relies on **three specific building blocks:**\r\n\r\n* **Massive Context:** Usefulness requires memory. If you ask an AI to book a vacation, it shouldn't just know ?beach.? \r\n\r\n  * Gavin?s example: For him, it needs to know he follows Andrew Huberman (so he needs an East-facing balcony for morning sunlight) and that he refuses to fly on planes without Starlink.\r\n\r\n* **Reliability:** The model can't just hallucinate a flight time. It needs to be boringly consistent.\r\n\r\n* **Task Length:** We are moving from ?Make me a reservation? (saves 5 mins) to ?Plan this entire trip for my extended family? (saves 5 hours).\r\n\r\n**WHY IT MATTERS:** This is the ?ROI handoff.? Raw intelligence is cool, but **Context** is the moat. Baker predicts that as context windows expand, AI will eventually hold every Slack message, email, and company manual you?ve ever written in its working memory; turning it into the ultimate Chief of Staff.\r\n\r\nHe also thinks this transition has huge ramifications for SaaS companies, who face a lesser of two evils bet on deploying agents at the cost of their margins to compete with VC-funded upstarts who will gladly outspend them, or risk total business extinction. \r\n\r\nHe had a lot more to say about Google, xAI, NVIDIA, AI ROI, and of course, space data centers. Definitely worth a full watch (and [read our favorite parts here](https://www.theneuron.ai/explainer-articles/gavin-baker-on-invest-like-the-best-re-why-the-next-massive-data-center-might-be-in-space)). \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2406a12e-9fba-4e0e-a97a-ac78b7d48009/image.png?t=1762454334)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**FROM OUR PARTNERS**\r\n\r\n# The facts are in.

[Sam Altman](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/enterprise-will-be-a-top-openai-priority) said OpenAI would prioritize enterprise in 2026, signaling a bigger push from ?cool models? to ?sellable workflows?; interestingly, [OpenAI](https://www.theverge.com/news/842657/openai-chatgpt-adult-mode-debut-q1-2026) will also debut its new ?adult mode?

[OpenEvidence](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chatgpt-doctors-startup-doubles-valuation-12-billion-revenue-surges) was reported to be raising at a $12B valuation as annualized advertising revenue hit $150M (tripling since August).\r\n\r\n5. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/shipping-sora-for-android-with-codex/) said a four?engineer team shipped Sora for Android in 28 days with Codex, hit #1 on Google Play, and saw Android users generate 1M+ videos in the first 24 hours (great write-up).\r\n\r\n6. [Every](https://every.to/source-code/how-every-is-harnessing-the-world-changing-shift-of-opus-4-5) shared five patterns it learned building with Claude Opus 4.5, arguing the big unlock is models that finish projects end?to?end (and the new bottleneck is your taste, not your syntax).\r\n\r\n7. [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/is-it-a-bubble) argued AI can be both real AND overheated, and that financing structure (cash vs leverage) is where bubbles become dangerous.\r\n\r\n8. [Anand Sanwal](https://anandsanwal.me/ai-education-death-spiral/) argued AI cheating is now normalized and that schools can?t out?police ubiquitous AI, so assessment has to change.\r\n\r\n9.
