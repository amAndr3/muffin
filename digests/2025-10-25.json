That's almost as many robots as they have human workers in the U.S. (1.2 million). And according to leaked internal documents, that ratio is about to flip hard.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times got their hands on Amazon's strategy docs, and holy shit?the plan is to automate 75% of U.S. operations by 2033. Translation: Amazon's sales are expected to double, but their workforce stays flat. They're planning to simply _not hire_ over 600,000 people who would otherwise be needed.\r\n\r\nThe math here is brutal but elegant: 30 cents saved per item processed, $12.6 billion saved between 2025-2027, all by avoiding hiring 160,000 workers in the next couple years alone.\r\n\r\n**Meet Your Replacement**\r\n\r\nAmazon's robot army isn't just bigger?it's getting smarter. There's **Vulcan**, their first robot with _tactile sensing_ that can feel its way around crowded bins without breaking stuff. **Digit**, a 5'9\" humanoid robot that walks on two legs like a person. **Proteus**, which hauls 800-pound carts around the warehouse floor.\r\n\r\nThe Shreveport, Louisiana facility is the blueprint: 2,500 humans, 1,000 robots, and it employs 25% fewer people than a traditional warehouse would. Amazon plans to roll this model out to 40 facilities by 2027.\r\n\r\n**The PR Strategy Is Almost Insulting**\r\n\r\nThe leaked docs reveal Amazon's plan to \"control the narrative.\" They literally discuss avoiding words like \"automation\" and \"AI\" in public communications. Instead: use \"advanced technology.\" Don't say \"robot\"?say \"cobot\" (collaborative robot) because it sounds friendlier.\r\n\r\nThey're also planning to boost \"community engagement\" to become a \"good corporate citizen.\" You know, like participating in parades and Toys for Tots while quietly engineering out hundreds of thousands of jobs.\r\n\r\nAmazon's response? Basically \"these are just one team's documents, not our actual strategy,\" while simultaneously pointing out they're hiring 250,000 seasonal workers (note: seasonal, not permanent).\r\n\r\n**Why This Actually Matters**\r\n\r\nDaron Acemoglu?the MIT professor who just won the Nobel Prize in Economics for studying exactly this shit?delivered the kill shot: \"Once they work out how to do this profitably, it will spread to others, too. One of the biggest employers in the United States will become a net job destroyer, not a net job creator.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he's right. Walmart's already announced 65% of stores will be \"serviced by automation\" by 2026. UPS eliminated 43,000 positions through AI. Amazon isn't an outlier?they're the template.\r\n\r\nThe kicker? Amazon was already facing a labor crisis. A 2021 internal memo warned they'd literally run out of American workers to hire by 2024 given their 159% annual turnover rate. So automation isn't just about efficiency?it's about survival when you've burned through your entire available workforce.\r\n\r\nThe future of work isn't robots taking every job. It's companies discovering they can grow massively while employing fewer people. Amazon's about to prove it's possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n**The New York Times - Original Investigation**\r\n\r\n* **Title**: \"Inside Amazon's Plans to Replace Workers with Robots\"\r\n\r\n* **URL**: **[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html)**\r\n\r\n* **Published**: October 21, 2025\r\n\r\n* **Note**: This is the original investigative report based on leaked internal Amazon documents?\r\n\r\n## Major News Organizations (Tier 1 Verification)\r\n\r\n**CNBC**\r\n\r\n* **Title**: \"Amazon debuts 'Blue Jay' robot that performs multiple tasks at once\"\r\n\r\n* **URL**: **[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/amazon-debuts-blue-jay-robot-that-performs-multiple-tasks-at-once.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/amazon-debuts-blue-jay-robot-that-performs-multiple-tasks-at-once.html)**\r\n\r\n* **Published**: October 22, 2025?\r\n\r\n**Forbes**\r\n\r\n* **Title**: \"Amazon Is Automating 600,000 Jobs.
