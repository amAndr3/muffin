They called it ?an important learning? as they explore AI's ?effective use.?\r\n\r\nWhy? Because viewers called it ?creepy,? ?poorly edited,? and ?the most god-awful ad I've seen this year.? The uncanny-looking characters and choppy stitched-together clips (most genAI clips are only 6-10 seconds, so a 45-second ad needs _tons_ of edits) didn't help. Comments also flagged concerns about job displacement: ?No actors, no camera team...welcome to the future of filmmaking.

And Gave Away the Entire Recipe\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e75b4f13-bd78-4e83-a071-17923e525376/Screenshot_2025-12-15_at_1.57.34_PM.png?t=1765835870)\r\nFollow image link: (https://lmstudio.ai/models)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**NEWS BRIEF: **[NVIDIA?s Nemotron 3 Nano, Explained](https://www.theneuron.ai/explainer-articles/nvidia-nemotron-3-nano-open-llm)\r\n\r\nWhile everyone's been watching Chinese labs dominate open source AI, NVIDIA quietly built something different: not the biggest model, but potentially the smartest architecture.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, [NVIDIA released Nemotron 3 Nano](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nemotron/Nemotron-3/), a 30-billion parameter model that's rewriting the efficiency playbook for open AI (_not to be confused with OpenAI, lol)_. The headline number: **up to 3.3x higher throughput** than comparable open models. But the real story is how they got there? and what they're giving away.\r\n\r\n**The hybrid architecture breakthrough:** Nemotron 3 Nano combines standard transformers with state space models in a mixture-of-experts design, activating only 3 billion parameters per token while maintaining access to the full 30 billion when needed. This is basically a fundamental rethink of how to build production AI systems.\r\n\r\n**The results show up where it matters:**\r\n\r\n* Bronze-medal performance on International Mathematical Olympiad benchmark.\r\n\r\n* 1 million token context windows.\r\n\r\n* Strong performance on agentic tasks.\r\n\r\n* Generates roughly 377 tokens per second (per Artificial Analysis benchmarks).\r\n\r\n**What makes this release different:** NVIDIA released the complete training recipe:\r\n\r\n* [3 trillion tokens of pretraining data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Agentic-v1).\r\n\r\n* Post-training datasets.\r\n\r\n* Reinforcement learning environments ([NeMo Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym) and [NeMo RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL)).\r\n\r\n* Infrastructure code.\r\n\r\nAs [Casper Hansen put it](https://x.com/casper_hansen_/status/2000585102821126196): ?NVIDIA is fast becoming open-source kings.?\r\n\r\nIf you want to run this yourself, you need: \r\n\r\n* A computer with at least 25GB of RAM. \r\n\r\n* [This model](https://lmstudio.ai/models/nemotron-3), which you can run with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/). \r\n\r\n**This matters because the open source AI landscape has shifted dramatically.** Nathan Lambert's [2025 tier list](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/2025-open-models-year-in-review) shows Chinese labs (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi) now define the frontier. No US company appears in the top tier. NVIDIA's response was to compete on efficiency _and_ openness. \r\n\r\n**Today's open source flood:** NVIDIA wasn't alone. Monday brought a coordinated wave of open releases:\r\n\r\n* [**OLMo 3.1**](https://allenai.org/blog/olmo3) from Allen AI extended their reinforcement learning runs by 21 days, producing the strongest fully open reasoning model?gaining +5 points on AIME math problems and +20 on instruction-following benchmarks. The [complete model flow](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/olmo-31) includes Think 32B for reasoning and Instruct 32B for chat / agents.\r\n\r\n* [**Bolmo**](https://allenai.org/blog/bolmo) introduces byte-level tokenization; processing raw bytes instead of subword tokens for better code, math notation, and multilingual text handling. Available in [7B](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Bolmo-7B) and [1B](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Bolmo-1B) sizes, able to run locally on something like LM Studio\r\n\r\n* [**DistillKit**](https://github.com/arcee-ai/distillKit) from Arcee AI provides open source tools for model distillation; compressing larger models into smaller, faster versions for edge deployment.\r\n\r\n**P.S:** You can see other new models that are [popular to run on your own computer here](https://lmstudio.ai/models); just follow the star and download count. \r\n\r\n**The strategic bet:** As AI agents become more autonomous and token volumes explode, inference efficiency (running AI) matters more than training scale. NVIDIA is positioning Nemotron as the architecture for production agentic systems, where generating hundreds of thousands of tokens per task makes cost-per-token the key metric.\r\n\r\nSuper and Ultra versions of Nemotron 3 are coming within months. If those extend the efficiency gains to larger-scale reasoning, NVIDIA may have found a path to frontier performance without frontier budgets.\r\n\r\nAll models are [available on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nvidia-nemotron-v3) with [local deployment options](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-GGUF). \r\n\r\n**P.P.S:** _Google's Gemma 4 (or something similar) is __[expected this week, too](https://huggingface.co/google)__.

His ?Deep Truth Mode? uses an 8-step forensic protocol that simultaneously steel-mans the mainstream position, the suppressed position, AND hybrid hypotheses?then red-teams all three to see what survives.\r\n\r\nIt only uses primary sources (patents, leaked documents, raw datasets, sworn testimony) and explicitly rejects fact-checker articles as evidence. The output includes a probability distribution on which hypothesis has the strongest explanatory power and flags any evidence of active suppression.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** It's designed to make AI question everything; including its own training data. And Brian says [CS classes are now using it](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele/status/2000660849812447323) to teach language model limitations; one group even turned it into a system prompt for an open-source model with ?better benchmarks across all testing.?
